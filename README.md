# AI Brain Extensions for MMTools

This project is a set of tools developed to extend MoreMountains game engines like [Corgi Engine](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/corgi-engine-2d-2-5d-platformer-26617?aid=1011lHJn) and [Top Down Engine](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/topdown-engine-89636?aid=1011lHJn).

# AI Brain Graph

The AI Brain graph lets you create AIBrains systems by using a node system.

## Features

* AI Brain Graph including:
  * States
  * Transitions
  * Actions
  * Decisions
* _AI Brain Generator_: to create Corgi AIBrain systems (with AIDecisions and AIActions)
* _AI Pluggable Brain_: to generate AI systems at runtime
